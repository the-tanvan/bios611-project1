## Project Proposal

### Dataset

This analysis is based on the listings dataset which was sourced from InsideAirBnB.com and was last updated on June 25, 2020. This dataset contains information on 2,407 different AirBnB listings in Asheville, North Carolina. Examples of included properties are superhost status, price, bedrooms, zipcode, and rating. In total, there are 106 points of data on each property.

### Preliminary Figures
* spread of reviews
* spread of prices (distribution, between room_type, square_feet etc)
* difference between superhosts and normal hosts

### Questions to Answer with Dataset
1. Is there a relationship between price and rating?
1. Do superhosts have higher ratings?
1. Can we predict price based on amentities and properties of the listing?
   
* Modeling or data visualizations
* Criteria for completion
